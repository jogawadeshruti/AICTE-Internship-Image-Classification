# AICTE-TECHSAKSHAM-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
A CNN based model trained on cifar10 dataset for image classifiaction 
# Introduction  
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for image classification. The model effectively learns patterns from images and classifies them into predefined categories. It is built with **TensorFlow** and can be used for applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, or other domain-specific tasks.Here we have used the CIFAR10 dataset for training the model.
