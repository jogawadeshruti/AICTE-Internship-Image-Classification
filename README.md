# AICTE-P1-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
A CNN based model trained on cifar10 dataset for image classifiaction 
# Introduction  
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for image classification. The model effectively learns patterns from images and classifies them into predefined categories. It is built with **TensorFlow** and can be used for applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, or other domain-specific tasks.Here we have used the CIFAR10 dataset for training the model.  

# Steps to initiate the project:

# 1.Clone the repository
  This the most crucial step to clone the repository because, Cloning a repository lets you download the project to your local machine, enabling you to work offline, test the code, and 
  contribute changes efficiently using Git.

# 2.Install Dependencies
Once youâ€™ve cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the necessary libraries such as Streamlit, scikit-learn, nltk, and others.

# 3.Run the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application with the following command:

    streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application in your browser. By default, it will run on localhost:8501.
